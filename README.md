# Approval Comments History LWC
If an object have multiple approval processes, that rely on different level of conditions and the latest approver will not be able to find every comments made by previous approvers. 
They can go back to the record and check each and every approval requests.
But that will be difficult if the approver is a busy as usual top level approvers. 
So I created a simple lightning web component to for this problem.
